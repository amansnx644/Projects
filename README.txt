INTRODUCTION:

The dataset contains information about the car prices.The data 
has been scraped from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the Grman eBay website.The data was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle.

AIM:

The main aim of this project is to perform basic exploratory analysis on the data and clean the the anomalities in data.

FINDINGS:

While exploring the odometer column we found that the values in this field are rounded, which might indicate that sellers had to choose from pre-set options for this field. Additionally, there are more high mileage than low mileage vehicles.

There were some anomalities in pricing column 1420 cars were priced 0 and the most expensive car in the list was'nt even the name of a car.There were aother anomalities also in the price column which are now fixed.

We explored the 'date_crawled' meta data column and found out about the crawling process in general and observed that the distribution of listings crawled on each day is roughly uniform.
